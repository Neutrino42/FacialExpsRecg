#### Some more notes:
Our visual recognition model is based on IBM cloud, which provides a 6-month trial period. Once the trial period end, the model will be no longer usable.

Students can sign up for an IBM cloud to use the Iaas, Paas and Saas service, and try to create and train a model yourself.
